# Ticket Booking Queue Project

A simple, command-line-based ticket booking system that uses a **Queue** data structure to manage bookings. This project demonstrates the core principles of a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) queue in a real-world application.

## üìÅ Project Structure

* `app.py`: The main application file that runs the booking system. It orchestrates the user interaction and the queue logic.
* `queue.py`: Contains the `Queue` class, which is a fundamental data structure implementation.
* `frontend.py`: Handles all user-facing functions, such as displaying menus and taking user input.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Book a Ticket**: Adds a new person to the booking queue.
* **Process Booking**: Confirms and removes the person at the front of the queue.
* **View Next**: Allows you to see who is next in line without processing their booking.
* **Check Size**: Displays the current number of people waiting.

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the main application file:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the ticket booking system.
